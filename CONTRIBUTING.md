# Contributing

Thanks for your help in contributing to Insight! This guide details how to use issues and pull requests to help improve Insight. 

## Submitting issues

Please open a GitHub [Issue on Insight](https://github.com/3Dparallax/insight/issues/new) with a clear description of what the problem you've encountered is. If possible, please include a URL or code sample that can reproduce the problem. 

Your Issue will be reviewed by one of our developers, and we will be happy to let you know about its status.

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub [Pull Request to Insight](https://github.com/3Dparallax/insight/compare) with a clear description of what you've done. Please follow our coding conventions, and try make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Your Pull Request will be reviewed by one of our developers and you will be asked to reformat it if needed. We try to be flexible, but this way we can ensure better maintenance and clarity. 

For consistency, we request that you prefix your Pull Request branch with your GitHub username followed by a dash.
